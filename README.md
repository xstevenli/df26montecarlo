# Monte Carlo simulation of 200 DF-26 missiles attacking U.S. bases and airfields.
# "data" folder contains parking spot coordinates for 120-, 24-, 12-, or 6-spot arrangements, corresponding to "baseline," "moderate dispersal," "dispersal," and "max dispersal" respectively.
# "baseline" simulates outcomes of basing all 120 F-22s in one single air base (Andersen AFB).
# "moderate_dispersal" simulates outcomes of basing 120 F-22s evenly in 5 air bases (Andersen AFB, Guam Int'l, Tinian Int'l, Rota Int'l and Saipan Int'l).
# "dispersal" simulates outcomes of basing 120 F-22s evenly in 10 air bases (abovementioned plus RAAF Darwin, RAAF Tindal, North Field Guam, North Field Tinian, and Minami Torishima).
# "max_dispersal" simulates outcomes of basing 120 F-22s evenly in 20 air bases (abovementioned plus Yap, Kosrae, Pohnpei, Chuuk, Wake Island, Palau Int'l, Angaur, Garden Point, Snake Bay, and Bathurst Island).
# "runs" contains sensitive analyses of various CEPs and IRs.
